# Regex Tutorial
A Regex which is short for regular expression, is a string of text that allows you to create patterns to match character combinations. Regex can help in many ways such as being able to verify an email address, a phone number and matching passwords as well.

## Summary

There are quite a bit of areas where Regex can be used but today we'll be going over being able to verify an email address. To begin we need to understand that a regular expression that matches all the possible valid email addresses does not exist. The best approach when validating is to limit the user's input from the beginning. Below is a snipit of what an email regex can look like.

```
'^([a-z0-9]+@[a-z]+\.[a-z]{2,3})$'
```

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are special characters have a particular job when it comes to regular expressions. They match a position before or after the characters. For example, The carrot anchor (^) matches the beginning of the text where the dollar sign ($) matches the end of the text.

### Quantifiers
When it comes to regular expression quantifiers, they match a number of instances of a character, group, or character class in a string. An example of a simple quantifier is a number in curly braces {n}. When the user appends it to a character, it specifies how many characters the user would want to match. Here is an example of that:
 /\d{4}/ matches a four-digit number.

### OR Operator
The following symbol, (|) represents the OR Operator which either matches what's to the left or right of the that symbol. Below is an example using the pipe symbol.

```
'^[A-Z0-9_!#$%&'*+/=?`{|}~^.-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+$'
```
### Character Classes
Character classes are commonly used when it comes to regular expressions. With the character classes, you can tell the regex to soley match one out of several characters and even use a hyphen to specify a range of charaacters which can be seen in our previous example.
```
'...[A-Z0-9.-]+$'
```
